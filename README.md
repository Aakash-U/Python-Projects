## üß† Concepts Touched So Far

As part of building these Python mini-projects, the following foundational concepts relevant to Data Science have been applied:

- **Control Structures**  
  Usage of loops (`for`, `while`) and conditional logic (`if`, `else`) to control the program flow.

- **Data Structures**  
  Use of Python data structures like `lists` and `dictionaries` for storing and manipulating data efficiently.

- **Functions & Modular Design**  
  Custom function definitions promote modular, readable, and reusable code.

- **Randomization & Simulations**  
  Use of Python's `random` module for simulations, which is foundational for modeling, probabilistic experiments, and algorithm testing.

- **String Manipulation**  
  Extensive manipulation of string data, which is essential for natural language processing (NLP), feature extraction, and data cleaning.

- **User Input & Interaction**  
  Handling dynamic user input and interpreting command-line interactions, useful in building interactive tools and prototypes.

> üîÑ This list will grow as I create new projects and explore more advanced concepts.
